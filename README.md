# HEX Color list

Simple tool and list of all named W3C colors, complete with name, hex and rgb() value, made to understand the principles behind the different values.

This is a work in progress.

It has three sections:

**The first section** is a guide to the W3C color names.

**In the second section** a color tester

**The third part** my favourite, lets the user create a custom color palette of five colors, modifying every parameter with sliders.

What do you think about it?
What do you think could be usefull to add?
Do you have an idea for improving it?
